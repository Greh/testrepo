Git Fat

This is a utility that supposedly reduces the amount of memory
binaries would take up in a repository.

To try it, I have copied one of my c project source
and binary files over to two different folders in this repo.

There is no distribution for this so I cloned the repo
here: https://github.com/jedbrown/git-fat

git clone https://github.com/jedbrown/git-fat.git

Then I added the repo to my PATH

Then made a file called .gitattributes in this repo
and added the binaries folder to it.

>>>>>>> Made change to binaries
1. Have binaries already in the file but not pushed to
remote.

Ran git fat init after all the above settings were done

Looks like this created fat/objects but nothing was in it

Continued with creating a git fat store locally following 
the example on the github account above.

At this point I have still not seen a git-fat commmit.

I will make a small change to my source files, compile and 
then submit again.

Problem - the filter works in a generic fashion. Not really
meant for specific files. Possibly useful if you are setting
up one git repository from scratch. Not good for migration.
=======
1. Never had a binary in this repo before and I know about git-fat
so this is a fresh start

Ran git fat init after all the above settings were done
