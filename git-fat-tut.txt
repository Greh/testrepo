Git Fat

This is a utility that supposedly reduces the amount of memory
binaries would take up in a repository.

To try it, I have copied one of my c project source
and binary files over to two different folders in this repo.

There is no distribution for this so I cloned the repo
here: https://github.com/jedbrown/git-fat

git clone https://github.com/jedbrown/git-fat.git

Then I added the repo to my PATH

Then made a file called .gitattributes in this repo
and added the binaries folder to it.

1. Never had a binary in this repo before and I know about git-fat
so this is a fresh start

Ran git fat init after all the above settings were done

Looks like this created fat/objects but nothing was in it

Continued with creating a git fat store locally following 
the example on the github account above.
