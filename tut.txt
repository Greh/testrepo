My git tutorial

1. Straightforward Merge:
	Master as 3 commits and a branch has 3 commits. Nothing is happening on remote
	To have all changes to be included in master
	do:
		git checkout master
		git merge branch
	There will be conflicts because one file is modified in two locations
	To accept all merges just do git add .
	Then it will ask for a merge commit message
	At this point master is ahead by 3 commits from origin/master
	Run git push origin master

2. What to do with tut.txt
	At this point tut.txt exists in master but not in br1
	Right now since br1 is merged, it can be deleted and recreated
	There is no remote br1 branch so this can be done
	
3. What if there was a remote branch too?
	I'm in master now, and none of my changes in br1 are visible.
	So I'll do a merge, and I will get some conflicts.
