My git tutorial

1. Merges
  
	a. Straightforward ones
		Master is being worked on by other people but you have branched off
		You want all your changes to be included in master
		You do:
			git checkout master
			git merge branch
		There will be conflicts because one file is modified in two locations
		To accept all merges just do git add .
		Then it will ask for a merge commit message
		At this point master is ahead by 3 commits from origin/master
		Run git push origin master
