My git tutorial

1. Straightforward Merge:
	Master as 3 commits and a branch has 3 commits. Nothing is happening on remote
	To have all changes to be included in master
	do:
		git checkout master
		git merge branch
	There will be conflicts because one file is modified in two locations
	To accept all merges just do git add .
	Then it will ask for a merge commit message
	At this point master is ahead by 3 commits from origin/master
	Run git push origin master

2. What to do with tut.txt
	At this point tut.txt exists in master but not in br1
	Right now since br1 is merged, it can be deleted and recreated
	There is no remote br1 branch so this can be done
	
3. What if there was a remote branch too?
<<<<<<< HEAD
	I'm in master now, and none of my changes in br1 are visible.
	So I'll do a merge, and I will get some conflicts.	
=======
	I have now checked out br1 later in the tree history
	I will add 3 commits to this branch
	Then do a git push to a remote branch also called br1
<<<<<<< HEAD
>>>>>>> br1
	Notice that it picked master first? - this is dicey when 
	doing it for files which are not that straightforward
	Doing git push origin master will push all the merges
        to master and br1 is still hanging over there

4. Rebasing:
	Master is one commit ahead right now.
	Applying 3 commits to br1
	Then do rebase so I can get this change that I did on master 
	
	Run git checkout br1
	Added commit 1 on top of br1
