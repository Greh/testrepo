So where does the branch fall depending on where you are.

HEAD is currently pointing to origin/master and the 
local master. I will add this file and then commit it
then I will run:

git push origin HEAD:refs/heads/a_branch

If you were to clone this repo from scratch, you
will not see this file. But if you checkout this
branch, you will see this file.

However, if you look at the git log, the commits
will be on top of the master commit.
